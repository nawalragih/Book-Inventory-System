# Book-Inventory-System
The "Book Inventory System" is a C++ program created to help users manage their book collections. It allows users to input book details such as title, author, price, and year of publication, which are then stored in an organized array of Book structures. The program includes a sorting feature that arranges books alphabetically by title using the insertion sort algorithm. Users can view their sorted book inventory in a formatted table, making it easier to browse and manage their collection.
